I would like to thank the project director Alfredo Vellido for his help, support and flexibility during this work. I would also like to thank Mar and my familiy for putting up with me in these busy months. Pero en especial quiero agradecer y dedicar este trabajo a mi abuela Alicia, a quien le hubiera hecho muy feliz verme acabar la carrera.
